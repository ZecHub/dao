[ZecHub](https://zechub.org/) is a decentralized education hub for Zcash, a cryptocurrency that protects your privacy. The goal of ZecHub is to provide an educational platform where community members can work together on creating, validating, and promoting content that supports the Zcash ecosystem. We do this through a few mechanisms such as tutorials, wiki, podcasts, and more.

You can find more information about ZecHub DAO on our [GitHub page](https://repo.zechub.org/) and our [voting platform](https://vote.zechub.org/).

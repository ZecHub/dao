[ZecHub](https://zechub.org/) have a few assets in its treasury. As an education hub, our goal is to provide informative content and support to the community. We received a grant from the Zcash Community Grants program, which enables us to create educational resources like tutorials, a wiki, and podcasts. These assets showcase our commitment to educating and empowering our community.

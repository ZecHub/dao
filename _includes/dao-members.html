      <p>I'm a diagrammer, graphic and packaging designer. My interest in blockchain, NFTs and cryptocurrencies started
        just three years ago. In May 2022 Iogy and I became the design team for Zcash Brasil, and since then I've been
        working on growing Zcash in Brazil, be it with my design and ideas or networking at events or making events
        happen. My goal now is to continue growing the Zcash community and the ecosystem that surrounds it by helping

# ZecHub DAO
Website for the ZecHub DAO

## Add Post
This site is built with Jekyll. To add a post:

1. Create a new file in your `_posts` directory with the following format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`. The year, month, and day should be numbers, and the title should be separated by hyphens. The markup can be either `.md` or `.html`, depending on whether you want to write your post in Markdown or HTML.
2. Add the front matter to your file. This is a YAML block that contains metadata about your post, such as the title, date, and author. Here's an example:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: “My First Post”
date: 2023-04-11 14:00:00 +0000
author: John Doe
---
```

3. Write your post content below the front matter. You can use Markdown or HTML to format your text.
4. Save your file and commit it to your repository.
